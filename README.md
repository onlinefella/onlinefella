- 👋 Hi, I’m @onlinefella 
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of stuff, mainly simple or easy to use code until I become more acquainted with how this all works.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use OBS and Streamlabs software so I can begin streaming on Twitch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun opportunities to make streaming more accessible and customizable for beginners.
